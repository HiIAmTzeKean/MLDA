# MLDA

## Inspiration There is a lot of food wastage in the world and we would like to use ML to classify food faster with less human input.

## What it does Uses Edge Impulse NN to classify apples into 3 categories (Ripe, Unripe, Rotten)

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into Lack of dataset for effective machine learning

## Accomplishments that we're proud of We manage to finish most of the work in 45H

## What we learned Basics of CNN, Web programming

## What's next for Apple Software Hardware integration to automatically remove rotten food, and to have a larger dataset to better remove fruits other than apples.
